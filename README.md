# daily-dev-log
Whether code, research, or server related, a place to record what I did on a day. 

 ## Goal
 Develop code, research libraries, or plan projects every single day for a year.

 ## Problem
 Github provides a contribution graph. This is available as a phone widget. It has been a great reminder of if I have coded today or not. However, this does not show progress for non coding dev related activities.

 ## Solution
 Create a daily development log repo. Daily contributions to it count as progress towards my goal. As a bonus, I will have a way to reference what I have done in the past.
